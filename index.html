    I am Genetics PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am interested in the mechanisms that drive evolutionary innovation. I work in the Currie Lab, where I use the fungus-farming ants as a model to investigate such evolutionary phenomena.
    Check out my site to learn more about me and my research.
