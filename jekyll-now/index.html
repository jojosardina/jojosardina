  <h1>Welcome to JoJo's Science Website!</h1>

    I am Genetics PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am interested in the mechanisms that drive evolutionary innovation. I work in the <a href="https://currielab.wisc.edu/">Currie Lab</a>, where I use the fungus-farming ants as a model to investigate these evolutionary mechanisms.
    Check out my site to learn more about me and my research.
