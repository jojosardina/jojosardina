	<h3>Research</h3>
	<p>The tremendous biodiversity of our planet is vast. 
	From whales the size of school busses, to the intricate mosaic paintings of butterfly wings. 
	There are endless examples of complex morphological and phenotypic diversity throughout the tree of life, but why and how do these evolutionary innovations arise? 
	These are simple yet sophisticated questions that researchers have been asking for centuries.
	</p>
	<p> As a PhD student in the <a href="https://currielab.wisc.edu/">lab of Dr. Cameron Currie</a>, JoJo is interested in investigating these mechanisms of evolutionary innovation. 
	The fungus-farming ants and their complex symbioses (see below) present an excellent model to investigate these evolutionary mechanisms. 
	Specifically, by taking an evolutionary developmental (Evo-Devo) approach, 
	he is working to uncover how this symbiosis has driven the genetic and morphological diversity of the fungus-farming ants.</p>

		<p>Fungus-growing “attine” ants (tribe Attini, subtribe Attina) engage in one of the most complex symbiotic relationships described in nature; a quadripartite ant-bacterial-fungal-parasite symbiosis. 
	The ants cultivate the fungus Leucoagricus spp (order Agaricales) for food in specialized gardens. 
	Leucoagricus spp. have coevolved with the ants for more than 60 million years, with the ant’s care for the fungus and provide it with nourishment in the form of fresh plant substrate that the ants forage. 
	Leucoagricus spp. produces gongylidia, a nutrient-rich fruiting-body that serves as the primary nutrient source for the colony. 
	<p>A third antagonistic symbiont, the fungus Escovopsis spp. (Ascomycota, Hypocreales), is a specialized parasite that constitutes a “crop disease” of attine fungiculture, competing with the ants to use the fungal cultivar as a nutrient source (Currie et al. 1999a).</p> 
	<p>To help protect the fungus from Escovopsis, attine ants have formed a second mutualism with the Actinobacteria, which produce antibiotics capable of inhibiting the growth of the parasitic Escovopsis (Currie et al. 1999b).</p> 
	The selective pressure to maintain this “service” of antibiotic defense against the parasitic fungus has pushed phenotypic innovation within the attine ants, resulting in specialized cuticular structure which house the Actinobacteria and provide them withnourishment through glandular secretions (Currie et al. 2006; Li et al. 2018).</p>
