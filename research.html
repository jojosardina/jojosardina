	<h3>Research</h3>
	<p>The tremendous biodiversity of our planet is vast. 
	From whales the size of school busses, to the intricate mosaic paintings of butterfly wings. 
	There are endless examples of complex phenotypic diversity throughout the tree of life, but why and how do these evolutionary innovations arise? 
	These are simple questions that researchers have been asking for centuries, but the answers are not so simple.
	</p>
	<p>Inspired by the work of Dr. Sean Carroll, JoJo is interested in investigating these mechanisms of evolutionary innovation. 
	As a PhD student in the Currie Lab, I am using the fungus-farming ants as a model to investigate these mechanisms. 
	Specifically, I am interested in how their complex symbioses has driven phenotypic evolution.</p>
	<p>To do this, JoJo is taking an evolutionary developmental (Evo-Devo) approach to investigate how the well-defined quadrapartite symbiosis of the fungus-farming ants has driven their genetic and phenotypic diversity.</p>
