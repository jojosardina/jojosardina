	<h3>Research</h3>
	<p>The tremendous biodiversity of our planet is vast. 
	From whales the size of school busses, to the intricate mosaic paintings of butterfly wings. 
	There are endless examples of complex morphological and phenotypic diversity throughout the tree of life, but why and how do these evolutionary innovations arise? 
	These are simple yet sophisticated questions that researchers have been asking for centuries.
	</p>
	<p> As a PhD student in the <a href="https://currielab.wisc.edu/">lab of Dr. Cameron Currie, JoJo is interested in investigating these mechanisms of evolutionary innovation.</a> 
	The fungus-farming ants and their complex symbioses (see below) present an excellent model to investigate these evolutionary mechanisms. 
	Specifically, by taking an evolutionary developmental (Evo-Devo) approach, 
	he is working to uncover how this symbiosis has driven the genetic and morphological diversity of the fungus-farming ants.</p>
